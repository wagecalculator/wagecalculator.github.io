Wage Calculator
====================

This is a simple SPA web application to help people recognize the equivalence of different
pay rates, without having to break out their own calculator - this website does it for you!

Building
----------

You'll need [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (current build uses v20.8.0;
[nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is a great tool to manage node.js versions) and
[trunk](https://trunkrs.dev/).

### Commands

```bash
npm install # sets up pico
trunk build # creates build outputs to `docs/`
```
